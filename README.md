## Description
Boom, Roasted was created to assist small scale commercial coffee roasters and avid home roasters with tracking their roasts and inventory while connecting them with a community of people with the common goal of roasting better coffee. The app allows users to: maintain a private inventory that is automatically updated with each completed roast, chart their roasts in real time based on the "main events" during the roast cycle, look up past roasts and add tasting or general notes for future reference, and participate in an online community geared towards giving advice, trading green and roasted coffee, and generally just connecting with other people interested in roasting.
